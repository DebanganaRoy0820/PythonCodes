#Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
#You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.
#Example 1:
#Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
#Output: "134"
def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        n1=int(num1)
        n2=int(num2)
        s=n1+n2
        return str(s)
